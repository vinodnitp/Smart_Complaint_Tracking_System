technology - various factors pose a constant challenge to city police, in their fight against crime.Certain simple precautions taken up by the public can go a long way in making policing more effective and reducing crime opportunities.Some of these precautions, which can be adopted by the public, are listed below. This is not an exhaustive list but an indicative one.</p>
<h3 id="color2">Doors And Windows</h3>
<ul id="tipslist">
    <li>Always keep your main door closed. Provide it with a peephole.</li>
    <li>Fix a metal grill or collapsible gate outside the main door, 
which will provide you the visibility without exposing you to threats.</li>
    <li>Ensure that the window grills are not screwed into the frames, but embedded in the cement work.</li>
    <li>Whenever you move into a new house, change the main door and back door locks.</li>
    <li>Where air-conditioners are fixed provide an additional grill outside.</li>
    <li>There is generally a spate of ‘window snatching' during the hot 
summer months. The public is advised to sleep at a certain distance from
                  the open windows.</li>
    <li>Do not keep valuables, purses, mobile phones, and wristwatches 
openly visible from outside. If possible fix mosquito nets on the nets, 
                 which won't cut off ventilation.</li>

control lights. If you are planning to be away from home for some days, 
install one                  of these gadgets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="color2">Going Out?</h4>
<ul id="tipslist">

interest in their feelings. Encourage them to share their concerns      
            and problems with you.</li>

them words that will help them feel comfortable discussing sex with     
             you. Explain that no one has the right to touch them in a 
way that makes them uncomfortable, including adults whom they know and 
trust.</li>

 you can protect them only if they tell you when something is wrong.</li>

<h4 id="color2">How To Avoid Identity Theft</h4>
<p>Identity Theft is a recent phenomenon. Globally, over 500,000 people 
are victims of this crime each year. The best protection always is 
prevention. Here are some tips to safeguard your good name:</p>
<ul id="tipslist">
    <li>BEWARE Any document that has personal financial information on it can give an identity thief a foothold into your life.</li>
    <li>Put the charge slip copies in a safe spot until your credit card bills arrive.</li>
    <li>After you've reconciled your bill, shred every statement, 
in­cluding credit card re­ceipts, old bank statements, medical 
statements, every­day bills and pre-approved credit card offers.</li>
    <li>Write clearly on all credit applications. Consistently and 
completely fill in all credit and loan applications using your full 
name, first, middle and last. Every bill that comes to your house should
 be addressed exactly the same.</li>
    <li>Monitor your credit accounts carefully, so you'll know if a bill's missing or unauthorised purchases have been made.</li>
    <li>Close out unused credit cards. Cutting them up is not enough.</li>
    <li>Limit the number of credit cards you carry. The fewer cards you have, the easier it is to track them.</li>
    <li>If you're moving, contact all your creditors and update them of 
your address changes immediately. You don't want credit in­formation and
 new credit cards being delivered to the wrong address.</li>
    <li>If your credit card expires and you don't receive a new one, call your creditor immediately.</li>
    <li>Don't provide your credit card number to anyone who con­tacts you through telephone solicitation.</li>
    <li>Make sure any online credit card charges are handled through a 
secure site or in an encrypted mode. You'll know you're on a secure site
 if the web page on which you conduct your trans­action begins with 
'https' instead of the usual 'http'.</li>
    <li>Only shop on websites that offer a privacy policy. Know how your
 personal information will be handled. Print out privacy policies, 
warranties, price guarantees and other important information.</li>
    <li>Be watchful of shoulder-surfers. At ATMs and phone booths, 
thieves will stand close enough to see PIN num­bers punched in by users.</li>
</ul>
